# OOPs_Concepts_in_Python

***The important things in OOP(Object Oriented Programming)'s in Python language :***

   * **Class**
        * *Its a Blueprint which is followed by objects*
        * *It is logical structure with some specific attributes and methods*
        * *class is a logical entity*
        
   * **Object**
        * *Its an instance/reference of a class*
        * *When we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory.*
        * *it may be a real world objects like pen,car,mouse,keyboard,humans etc*
        * *Object is the physical entity*
        
   * **Abstraction**
        * *hiding the important data or implementation data* 
        * *showing the essential data*
            > Ex: we do install .exe application that is called essential data , but we dont care about implementation data that is we dont bother about the background data/process.
            
   * **Encapsulation**
        * *Binding/wrapping up the data & functions into a single entity*
        * *To achieve the encapsulation we do use access specifier:-*
              - *Public:* *Accessed by any function in any class*
   - Inheritance 
   - Polymorphism
   

   
         
         
   


   

   ### **Class Variable Explanation** :- ***Program_1.py***
  
  *The Program_1.py will explains us about the declaration of class variable & how we can call it within a class ,
    and also the program will shows the company's employee email id and employee salary , annual appraisal value.*
